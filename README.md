1. I think no. As stated in the lab the cons of unit testing is "Cannot test how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level". Messaging includes multiple actions that interact with each other (like store the message, display the message, send the message etc) which can be challenging and not efficient to test with unit testing. Unit testing is more suitible for small scale portions of the code.
2. I think yes in this case. Max message length is a very specific small feature that can be tested without using unrelated parts of the code which makes it easy to teast with using unit testing.
