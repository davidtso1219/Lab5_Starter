1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Personally I wouldn't because using unit tests to test messaging is inefficient since the con of unit testing is you cannot test how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level menaing that you require outside interaction other devices which with unit testing is only really good for indivdual tests.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

   yes because this test is done on on a individual application that can be given a input and immediately given a output that is correct or not.
