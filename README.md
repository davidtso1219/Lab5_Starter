# Lab 5 - Starter
1. I would not write a unit test for the messages componenet. This is an individual feature you can test but there are other moving parts. While there are still isolated components that you are able to test the message feature is to wide to have a specific unit test for. 
2. However if you are testing the max messsage length there is one specific test that you can run to look for the proper length. Unlike the entire messages component it is simply done with a check on the length.
