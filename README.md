1. Yes, I would use a unit test for the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are good for testing individual parts of the code in isolated mode, such as the functionality for writing and sending the message. In this case, we can ensure that the message sending functionality works correctly. 

2. I think I would use a unit test to test the feature 'max message length' because it relates to a specific behavior when message is inputting, which is what unit test suitable for.
