Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest


1. No. This is because I don't think that thid feature could be tested as testing this feature requires validating multiple components working together such as UI, server, and the delivery of the message. This could however be tested during the development using end-to-end testing; as in one could send messages to the other on the app and check if it works.

2. Yes. This feature can be effectively tested using unit tests as the validation of a message cuold be checked by a function if the input exceeds 80 characters. Unit tests would be more effecient for tasks that can have an isolated logic.
