1. No, you would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a message application. This is because it would require the code to interact with another device which is not possible in the realm of unit tests due to the many moving parts.
2. Yes, you would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature. This is because it is an enclosed part of the application and has the ability to be tested by inputting a test input and checking if the expected output is returned.
