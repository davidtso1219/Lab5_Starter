### Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest

1) No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because it has to work in tandem with the rest of the deatures since the messaging deature is a key component. It would be difficult to test the functionality with a simple unit test.

2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because since it is only a small part of the code and it would be possible to test to ensure that the max length is set properly.
