## Answers:
- 1). Unit tests could be very helpful when testing a messaging application's "message" feature as they can verify the basic functionality of composing and sending messages between users. Unit Testing can also ensure that messages are formatted correctly and that the details of the sending process, including the recipient and storage of the message, are all correct. We can also consider edge cases by handling cases with empty messages.

- 2). Unit tests would be very suitable for testing a messaging application's "max message length" feature. These tests can cover various scenarios, such as entering messages of different lengths, including messages that are exactly 80 characters long and messages that exceed the limit. For instance, we can test a scenario such as typing a message longer than 80 characters and verifying that the application correctly truncates the message or displays an error message.
