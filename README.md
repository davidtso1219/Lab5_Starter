1. Yes, I'd consider using a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. It would help ensure that individual components like the message-sending function itself will work correctly in isolation and could verify that messages are sent to the intended recipient without errors.
2. Yes, in the same vein, I'd also use it to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging app. The individual test would verify the length of the message before allowing it to pass.
